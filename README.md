Hierarchical Clustering in Machine Learning
📘 Overview

Hierarchical Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points into clusters based on their similarity. Unlike K-Means, it does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand. It builds a hierarchy (tree-like structure) of clusters known as a dendrogram, which helps visualize how data points merge or split at different levels of similarity.

⚙️ How It Works

Calculate Distance Matrix – Compute distances (e.g., Euclidean) between all data points.

Merge Closest Clusters – Initially, each point is its own cluster; the algorithm merges the two closest clusters step by step.

Update Distances – After merging, recalculate distances between the new cluster and the others.

Repeat Until One Cluster Remains – Continue merging until all points form a single large cluster.

Dendrogram Analysis – The optimal number of clusters is determined by “cutting” the dendrogram at a certain height.

🧩 Types of Hierarchical Clustering

Agglomerative (Bottom-Up) – Starts with individual points and merges them step by step. (Most common approach)

Divisive (Top-Down) – Starts with one large cluster and divides it into smaller ones.

📊 Linkage Methods

Linkage defines how the distance between clusters is measured:

Single Linkage – Minimum distance between points in clusters

Complete Linkage – Maximum distance between points in clusters

Average Linkage – Average distance between all points in clusters

Ward’s Method – Minimizes the variance between clusters

🧠 Advantages

No need to predefine the number of clusters

Dendrogram provides intuitive visualization

Works well for hierarchical or nested data structures

⚠️ Limitations

Computationally expensive for large datasets

Sensitive to noise and outliers

Once clusters are merged or split, they cannot be undone

📚 Applications

Customer segmentation

Document or text clustering

Gene or protein analysis in bioinformatics

Social network analysis

🏁 Conclusion

Hierarchical Clustering is a powerful technique for exploratory data analysis and pattern recognition. It helps uncover hidden structures in data and provides meaningful insights through its tree-based visualization.
